# A repository for FRIEND-related analyses

The Fitness Registry and the Importance of Exercise International Database (FRIEND) is a database containing variables from cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX). The database has been used to create a number of reference standards for CPX variables. This repository contains functions/packages for analysis based on these previously published FRIEND papers. 

I have a separate repository for individuals using R - "FRIENDanalysis"

## ref_calcs

### Function: friend_percentile
This function determines the age/sex/mode-specific VO2max percentile according to the FRIEND 2021 reference standards (Kaminsky et al. MCP 2021). These reference standards were created from a cohort of apparently healthy individuals living in the United States.
